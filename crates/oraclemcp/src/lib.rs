//! Library surface of the engine-free `oraclemcp` server (Phase-E E-2b).
//!
//! The binary ([`main`](../main.rs)) is a thin CLI over this library: it builds
//! the [`registry::tool_registry`] + [`registry::capabilities`] and dispatches
//! the seven read-only live-DB tools through [`dispatch::OracleDispatcher`] on
//! top of `oraclemcp-core`'s rmcp server. Exposing these here (rather than as
//! `bin`-private modules) lets the integration suite drive the real server
//! surface.
