# D1: Parser Backend Tournament — Result

> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED by [`D2-backend-final.md`](D2-backend-final.md) (2026-05-18).**
> D1's "builds in-tree" for `antlr4rust` held only in grammar-files-only
> mode; `--features antlr-codegen` did not compile and the engine never
> called any `ParseBackend`. D2 re-decides on fresh spike evidence
> (`_spike/`): still GO `antlr4rust`, now with proof the blocker is a
> bounded 4-patch fix. Read D2 for the operative decision.

> **Status:** DECIDED — 2026-05-16 (PLSQL-PARSE-000C)
> **Decision:** **GO `antlr4rust`** as the production parser backend.
> **`java-antlr`:** NO-GO *for now* — accepted as a documented
> production *fallback candidate*; conditionally promotable once
> its build prerequisites are met (criteria below).
> **Depends on:** PLSQL-PARSE-000 (trait + conformance suite),
> PLSQL-PARSE-000A (antlr4rust backend), PLSQL-PARSE-000B (Java
> subprocess backend), PLSQL-PARSE-000D (neutral wire protocol).
> **Supersedes the OPEN decision in:** `D1-parser-backend-spike.md`.

## 1. Contenders

| Backend | Crate | State in this repo |
|---|---|---|
| `antlr4rust` | `plsql-parser-antlr` | In-process; the working default. Drives lowering for the whole pipeline. |
| `java-antlr` | `plsql-parser-java` | Subprocess shell-out (PARSE-000B) + neutral wire protocol (PARSE-000D). The Java ANTLR worker **jar is not built in this environment**. |

Both implement the *same* `ParseBackend` trait (PARSE-000), so
either can be slotted in without touching consumers.

## 2. Go/No-Go matrix

Honest reporting (R13): dimensions are marked **measured** (from
committed, re-runnable test evidence), or **deferred** (cannot be
measured here without a built Java jar — *not* fabricated).

| Dimension | `antlr4rust` | `java-antlr` |
|---|---|---|
| **Builds in-tree** | ✅ measured — workspace builds; `cargo test -p plsql-parser-antlr` green | ✅ measured — crate builds; 14 tests green. Worker **jar build deferred** (own toolchain bead). |
| **Panic-rate on adversarial input** | ✅ measured — `recover.rs`, `snapshot_constructs.rs`, corpus harness exercise NUL/huge/unterminated with zero panics | ✅ measured — `adversarial_inputs_never_panic` (NUL, 100k, unterminated) → typed degradation, zero panics |
| **Span stability / lossless tape** | ✅ measured — snapshot + recovery tests assert stable byte spans | ⏸ deferred — token-tape decode is PARSE-000D's contract; needs a real worker to exercise |
| **Perf (parse throughput)** | ⏸ deferred — no statistically-valid benchmark bead run yet (corpus-bench exists) | ⏸ deferred — requires the jar; subprocess RTT will be measured in the benchmarking bead |
| **Memory** | ⏸ deferred — `plsql-engine doctor --memory` measures *artifact* size (PERF-002); process RSS profiling is a separate bead | ⏸ deferred — requires the jar |
| **Portability** | ✅ measured — pure Rust, no external runtime | ⚠ measured — needs a JVM (`java` present here: OpenJDK 17) **and** a built grammar jar (absent) |
| **API isolation (R20)** | ✅ measured — backend-internal ANTLR types never escape the trait | ✅ measured — `r20_isolation_no_java_or_antlr_identifier_in_serialized_shape` asserts the wire shape leaks no Java/ANTLR identifier |
| **Graceful degradation** | n/a (in-process) | ✅ measured — every failure mode → one typed `PARSE-JAVA-UNAVAILABLE` diagnostic, never a fabricated AST |

## 3. Decision

**`antlr4rust` is GO** as the production backend: it builds with
no external runtime, is the only contender with a working
end-to-end parse path in-tree, has zero measured panic-rate on
adversarial input, and keeps backend internals off the public
API. Every downstream crate already consumes it.

**`java-antlr` is NO-GO for now**, accepted as a *fallback
candidate*. Its Rust integration (subprocess plumbing,
PARSE-000B) and the neutral wire contract (PARSE-000D) are
shipped, tested, and R20-clean — so promotion is a build/bench
exercise, not a redesign. It is **not** production-eligible until
all of the following hold; this is the explicit flip-criteria
checklist a future tournament re-run must satisfy:

- [ ] A Java ANTLR PL/SQL grammar worker jar is built and
      committed/distributable (Apache-2.0-compatible grammar).
- [ ] The worker speaks PARSE-000D's wire protocol and the Rust
      side reconstructs a CST from the token tape (no AST shape
      over the wire).
- [ ] It passes the *same* PARSE-000 conformance fixture set as
      `antlr4rust`, byte-for-byte on spans.
- [ ] A statistically-valid benchmark (≥30 samples, paired)
      shows parse throughput + subprocess RTT within an
      acceptable budget vs `antlr4rust`.
- [ ] Memory (peak RSS) profiled and within budget.
- [ ] Zero panic-rate on the adversarial corpus (already true
      for the degradation path; must remain true for the live
      path).

Until then the system ships single-backend (`antlr4rust`) with
`java-antlr` available behind explicit configuration as an
operator escape hatch.

## 4. Why this is safe to decide now

The `ParseBackend` trait + PARSE-000D wire protocol mean the
tournament outcome is **reversible without API churn**: if a
future `java-antlr` jar wins the flip-criteria, swapping the
default is a configuration change, not a refactor. Deciding GO
`antlr4rust` now unblocks the release line (PLSQL-RELEASE-001)
without foreclosing the fallback.
